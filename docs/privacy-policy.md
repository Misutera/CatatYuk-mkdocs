## III. Profiling, Access & Security

### 1. Profiling and automated decision-making
**How we use profiling (if at all)**  
To help you run your business more efficiently, CatatYuk may perform limited automated analysis on account and transaction data — for example:
- generating aggregated insights and trends (cashflow categories, expense breakdowns);
- producing non-binding risk or anomaly signals (e.g., potential duplicate transactions, unusual spending patterns) to help spot errors or fraud; and
- creating product-personalization suggestions (onboarding tips, feature recommendations) to reduce time-to-value.

**Legal basis and choice**  
Such profiling is performed either on the basis of our legitimate interest to improve and secure the service, or on your consent where required. Where we rely on consent for profiling, we will obtain that consent clearly and record it; you can withdraw consent at any time (see “Your rights” below).

**No fully automated decisions that have legal or similarly significant effects**  
We do not make fully automated decisions that produce legal effects or similarly significant consequences for you (for example, account suspension, denial of access, or other materially adverse outcomes) without human review. Any automated signals that could influence a significant decision will be reviewed by a CatatYuk employee before action is taken.

### 2. Who may access your Personal, Financial Data, and Payment Data
**Internal access** – The following CatatYuk teams may access your data for legitimate business purposes and only on a need-to-know basis:
- Customer Success & Support (to troubleshoot issues and help you onboard);
- Engineering & Operations (to maintain, run and secure the platform);
- Product & Analytics (to improve features using aggregated or pseudonymized data);
- Billing & Finance (to manage subscriptions and invoicing); and
- Legal & Compliance (for legal requests, audits, or investigations).

All internal access is governed by role-based permissions, least-privilege controls, logging, and mandatory training on data protection.

**External recipients (processors and third parties)** – We sometimes share your data with carefully selected third parties who act as data processors or joint controllers under written agreements that limit their use of data. These include:
- Cloud hosting and infrastructure providers;
- Payment processors and billing partners;
- Integration partners you enable (bank connectors, marketplace connectors);
- Analytics and monitoring providers (for performance and error reporting); and
- Legal advisors, auditors, or regulators where required by law.

We never sell your Personal or Financial Data. If CatatYuk (or its assets) is ever transferred in a sale, we will provide notice and continue to protect your data under contract; the buyer would become the new controller for transferred data.

### 3. Where we store data and cross-border transfers
**Storage location** – By default CatatYuk stores and processes data on secure servers located in Jakarta. Where we must transfer or process data outside Indonesia (for example, to a global cloud provider region or a partner), we do so only with appropriate safeguards.

**Cross-border transfers** – Cross-border transfers are performed in accordance with UU No. 27/2022 and implementing rules. We rely on one or more of the following safeguards before transferring personal data abroad: (i) transfer to a country with an adequate level of protection; (ii) appropriate safeguards such as contractual clauses or binding policies; or (iii) explicit consent from the data subject if required by law. CatatYuk documents and monitors cross-border transfers and can provide details on request.

### 4. Security measures and breach handling
**Technical & organisational measures** – We apply industry-standard technical and organisational safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the data, including but not limited to:
- encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest;
- strong access controls and role-based permissions (least privilege);
- secure development practices and regular vulnerability assessments; and
- regular encrypted backups.

We also require our processors and partners to implement comparable security measures through binding contracts.

**Data breach notification** – If CatatYuk becomes aware of a personal data breach that is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, we will follow our incident response procedures and notify affected individuals and the competent authorities in accordance with UU No. 27/2022 and applicable implementing rules.

### 5. Your rights and how to exercise them (under UU PDP)
Under UU No. 27/2022 you have rights as a Data Subject. These include the right to:
- obtain clear information on how we process your data;
- access and obtain a copy of your Personal Data;
- request correction or completion of inaccurate or incomplete data;
- request deletion or destruction of your Personal Data (when permitted by law);
- withdraw consent where processing is based on consent;
- object to processing based on legitimate interest;
- request restriction of processing in certain circumstances;
- request portability of Personal Data you provided in a structured, machine-readable format; and
- object to automated decision-making or profiling that produces legal or similarly significant effects.

### How to exercise your rights
You may exercise your rights by:
1. Using the data management / privacy tools in your CatatYuk account (recommended); or
2. Sending an email to **privacy@catatyuk.com** with the subject line: “Data Privacy Request_[Your name]”, describing the request and the email used for the account.

For verification we may ask for reasonable proof of identity (e.g., a photo of an ID or confirmation from the account admin). We delete any identity proof after verification unless retention is required by law.

We will acknowledge simple requests promptly and handle requests in accordance with UU No. 27/2022. Where a request is complex we will inform you about any extension, the reason, and expected timing. Where permitted by law, we may refuse manifestly unfounded or excessive requests (e.g., repetitive requests) and will tell you why.

If you are not satisfied with our response, you may lodge a complaint with the competent data protection supervisory authority in Indonesia, or pursue other remedies provided by law. We also welcome you to contact us first at **privacy@catatyuk.com** so we can try to resolve the issue directly.
